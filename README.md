## Problem Statement

Title: HR Analytics Dashboard: Unveiling Insights 

Introduction:

In the ever-evolving landscape of Human Resources (HR), organizations are increasingly recognizing the significance of data-driven decision-making to optimize workforce performance and employee satisfaction. This realization has paved the way for the development of comprehensive HR analytics dashboards, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights into their human capital. This report delves into the creation of an HR analytics dashboard, focusing on key entities such as educational backgrounds and diverse workforce demographics, to address critical aspects of employee attrition, departmental dynamics, and overall workforce satisfaction.

Entities:

Educational Backgrounds:

Associates Degree
Bachelors Degree
Doctoral Degree
High School
Masters Degree
Tables Requirements:

Education Field-wise Attrition:
Analyzing attrition rates based on different educational backgrounds to understand if there are patterns or trends related to specific fields of study. This helps in tailoring recruitment and retention strategies according to the educational needs of the workforce.

Department-wise Attrition:
Examining attrition rates across various departments within the organization to identify potential areas of concern or success. This allows HR professionals to pinpoint which departments may require additional support or strategic interventions.

Number of Employees by Age Group:
Categorizing the workforce into age groups to gain insights into the distribution of employees across different stages of their professional lives. This analysis aids in workforce planning, succession management, and understanding generational dynamics within the organization.

Job Satisfaction:
Assessing job satisfaction levels among employees through surveys or feedback mechanisms. Understanding the factors that contribute to job satisfaction is crucial for retaining talent and fostering a positive work environment.

Attrition Rate of Gender by Age Group:
Exploring the attrition rates based on both gender and age groups. This analysis helps identify potential gender-related disparities in attrition and provides insights into whether certain age groups or genders are more susceptible to turnover.

Problem Statement:

The creation of this HR analytics dashboard addresses the pressing need for organizations to align their workforce strategies with data-driven insights. The lack of a comprehensive tool that integrates educational backgrounds, departmental dynamics, age demographics, and job satisfaction metrics often leaves HR professionals making decisions based on incomplete information. The absence of such a tool can lead to suboptimal workforce management, ineffective talent retention, and a failure to capitalize on the organization's human capital.

This report seeks to bridge this gap by developing an HR analytics dashboard that empowers HR professionals to make informed decisions, enhance employee engagement, and proactively address attrition challenges. Through a detailed analysis of educational backgrounds, departmental dynamics, age demographics, and job satisfaction metrics, organizations can cultivate a strategic approach to workforce management that is rooted in data-driven insights.
